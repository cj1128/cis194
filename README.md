# CIS 194

review of Brent Yorgey's course: [Intruduction to Haskell(Spring 2013)](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/)



## Note

- Charpter 7, exercise 4, I found most solutions on the web are not correct, they didn't create a balanced tree. My own solution did create a balanced tree, but my `replaceLine` implementation produces an unbalanced tree after replace some line, maybe I will find out a best solution in the future.
